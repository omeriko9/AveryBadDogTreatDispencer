# AveryBadDogTreatDispencer
A dog treat dispencer for dogs that suffer from anxiety when their owner leaves home

My neighbour has a rescue dog that is barking non stop after she leaves the house
We thought of having some sort of contraption that will detect him getting close to the door or could be connected to a web panel that she can connect to from remote, and that will release treats for her dog.

This is a preliminary project, since the code is currently super simple and includes only the part that moves the servo to release a treat. 
I will update it as it progresses.

There is, however, a very rough prototype that demonstrates the idea mechanically:
